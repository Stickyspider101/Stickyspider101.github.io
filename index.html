			<h3>The Hunt 486 - Part I</h3>
			<p class="caption">January 14, 2023</p>
			<hr class="dashed">
			<p>&emsp;To kick off this blog, I've decided to start with a challenge to fulfill by the end of this website: Find a computer made prior to the year 2000, and run an original copy of Unreal Tournament on it. It's actually something that I've been wanting to do for a while, but just haven't actually put any effor into doing. As of yesterday (1/13/2023), the hunt has officially began. The rules for this challenge are quite simple:
			<br>1) The computer must have been manufactured prior to 2000, and must not have any aftermarket parts made after 2000 (replacement power cables and PSUs are fine, but everything else is a no-go).
			<br>2) It must be able to run Unreal Tournament. If it cannot, I will have to hunt down parts to upgrade it.
			<br>3) It must have a floppy disk drive. If it does not, I will have to find a floppy disk drive.
			<br>4) I must find it locally, I cannot order the PC or any replacement parts. 
			<br>&emsp;This may seem like a fairly simple challenge, but I have a feeling this hunt will take years. I'm all set to take it on, however, and have already began working towards it. To keep everyone updated, I'll post progress on the search at the end of every blog post. If anyone wishes to play along, email me any major progress in your own searches. Happy hunting!</p>

			<h2 class="centertxt">About Me (and the Site)</h2>
			<p>
			&emsp;I'm a programmer/game developer based out of the Southeast United States. I've been around computers since i was 6, and have been working on developing software since I was 12. It's by far my biggest passion, and I've grown to love developing 
			software. This blog is a little side project of mine, cataloguing random interesting things I come across and general things about computers, games, software, and all things tech. Enjoy the site!
