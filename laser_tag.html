			<h2>THE PLAN</h2>
			<p class="caption">First written 09/17/2023</p>
			<p>Last week, I went to a laser tag arena for the first time. After playing a couple of rounds, I found some shortcomings with the arena's laser tag design. I've chosen to make my own laser tag equipment, fixing some of the issues that were present with the older equipment. Most of the parts I'll need could probably be taken from other electronics, whether it be controls or the lasers themselves, but the prototypes may end up being costly to produce. That being said, the parts I plan to build are as such:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Detection Vest</li>
					<dd>- Using photoresistors to detect laser input</dd>
					<dd>- Will have 5 detection spots; 1 on the back, 2 on the chest, and 2 on the shoulders</dd>
					<dd>- Will contain an internal power supply, most likely stores on the lower back</dd>
					<dd>- Will be able to determine if the hit came from a friendly or enemy</dd>
				<br>
				<li>Laser Blaster</li>
					<dd>- Will be able to shoot lasers and tag other vests (duh)</dd>
					<dd>- Will have a sight system, more than likely either crude iron sights or a basic reflector sight (similar to a Walther MRS)</dd>
					<dd>- Will have a stock, allowing for faster and more accurate aiming</dd>
					<dd>- Will require two hands to fire, using a touch detection system in the handguard</dd>
					<dd>- (Optional) Will have an attachment system for different sights and/or grips</dd>
					<dd>- Will have a display built-in to show if the player has been tagged, who they have tagged, and their score</dd>
					<dd>- Will have an internal battery, but will be connected to the vest (either by Bluetooth or by a cable)</dd>

				<p>This project <i>is</i> in its infancy, so it'll take a while before I have any tangible work done. Nonetheless, I'm going to continue working on the project, posting semi-frequent updates on my Instagram story <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stickyspiderware/">(here)</a> and weekly updates on this blog.</p>
				<p>Happy Blasting!</p>
